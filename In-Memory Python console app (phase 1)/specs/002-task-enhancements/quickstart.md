# Quickstart Guide: Task Organization and Usability Enhancements

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the new features in the Todo In-Memory Python Console Application, including priority assignment, search, filter, and sort capabilities.

## New Features

### 1. Assigning Priority to Tasks
When adding or updating a task, you'll now be prompted to assign a priority level:
- High: For urgent or important tasks
- Medium: For standard priority tasks
- Low: For tasks that can be deferred

### 2. Searching Tasks
From the main menu, select the "Search Tasks" option and enter a keyword. The application will search both the title and description fields for matches.

### 3. Filtering Tasks
Use the "Filter Tasks" option to narrow down your task list:
- Filter by completion status (all, complete only, incomplete only)
- Filter by priority (all, high only, medium only, low only)

### 4. Sorting Tasks
Use the "Sort Tasks" option to organize your task list:
- Sort by title (alphabetically)
- Sort by priority (high to low)
- Sort by completion status

## Running the Application
1. Ensure you have Python 3.13+ installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: `python src/main.py`
4. Follow the menu prompts to access all features

## Example Workflow
1. Add a few tasks with different priorities
2. Use search to find specific tasks
3. Apply filters to focus on specific subsets
4. Sort tasks to organize your view
5. Update priorities as needed
